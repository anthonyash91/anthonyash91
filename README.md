# Junior Full-Stack Developer With A Passion For Frontend

I am a recent graduate of General Assembly's SEI bootcamp, where I spent over 500 hours learning the fundamentals of full-stack development. My passion is frontend development as I love to bring designs to life with thousands of lines of code.

As a passionate full-stack Software Engineer (with a focus on Front-end) with experience in creating beautiful, user-friendly, UX-rich web applications utilizing front and back-end programming languages and frameworks, I enjoy being a problem solver who comes up with creative ways to make an impact on the end userâ€™s experience.

My passion for Software Engineering comes from an innate desire to create and provide people with exciting experiences. Nothing excites me more as an Engineer than being able to present others with a finish product Iâ€™ve helped create from scratch.

### Skills:
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- NodeJS
- React
- Express
- MongoDB
- Postman
